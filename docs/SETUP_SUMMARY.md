# 📋 Custom Environment Setup - Complete Solution

## 🎯 What We Created

I've created a comprehensive development environment setup for your Caja backend project. Here's everything that was included:

### 🛠️ Core Setup Files

1. **`setup.sh`** - Main automated setup script for macOS
   - Installs Homebrew, Python 3.11, Poetry
   - Configures Poetry environment
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Sets up Docker services
   - Creates utility scripts

2. **`setup-windows.sh`** - Windows setup script for team members on Windows

3. **`validate-setup.sh`** - Validation script to verify everything works

### 📁 Documentation

4. **`README.md`** - Updated main readme with quick start instructions
5. **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Comprehensive development guide
6. **`Makefile`** - Make commands for common tasks

### 🔧 Utility Scripts (Created by setup.sh)

The setup script creates these utility scripts:

- **`start-dev.sh`** - Starts PostgreSQL, Redis, runs migrations, starts FastAPI
- **`stop-dev.sh`** - Stops all development services
- **`run-tests.sh`** - Runs tests and code quality checks
- **`reset-db.sh`** - Resets database (destructive)

### 📝 Updated Configuration

7. **`.gitignore`** - Enhanced with Python-specific ignores
8. **`backend/.env`** - Created from template

## 🚀 How Team Members Use It

### New Team Member Setup (1 command!)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd conflicto
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

That's it! Everything will be installed and configured automatically.

### Daily Development

```bash
# Start working
./start-dev.sh

# Run tests
./run-tests.sh

# Stop when done
./stop-dev.sh
```

### Using Make Commands

```bash
make setup      # Same as ./setup.sh
make start      # Same as ./start-dev.sh  
make test       # Same as ./run-tests.sh
make stop       # Same as ./stop-dev.sh
make help       # Show all available commands
```

## ✅ What Gets Installed Automatically

- ✅ **Homebrew** (macOS package manager)
- ✅ **Python 3.11** (correct version for your project)
- ✅ **Poetry** (dependency management)
- ✅ **All Python dependencies** (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- ✅ **Docker services** (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- ✅ **Database migrations**
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks**
- ✅ **Development utilities**

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **One-Command Setup** - New developers can start in minutes
2. **Consistent Environments** - Everyone uses the same Python/Poetry setup
3. **Cross-Platform** - Works on macOS, with Windows script included
4. **Error Handling** - Setup script handles common issues
5. **Validation** - Includes validation script to verify setup
6. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for different scenarios
7. **Flexible** - Multiple ways to run (scripts, Make, manual)

## 🔍 Validation

After any setup, team members can run:

```bash
./validate-setup.sh
```

This checks:
- Poetry installation and environment
- Python 3.11 configuration
- Dependency installation
- Docker status
- Application import test
- Script availability

## 🚨 Error Handling

The setup script handles common issues:

- **Python version conflicts** - Automatically uses Python 3.11
- **Poetry environment issues** - Creates fresh environment
- **Dependency conflicts** - Uses Poetry's lock file
- **Missing tools** - Installs via Homebrew
- **Permission issues** - Sets proper executable permissions

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- Poetry with Python 3.11 ✅
- All dependencies installed ✅
- FastAPI app imports successfully ✅
- Environment file configured ✅
- Validation script working ✅

⚠️ **Notes:**
- Docker Desktop needs manual installation (one-time)
- Utility scripts will be created when setup.sh runs
- Team members just need to run `./setup.sh` once

## 🎉 Next Steps

Your custom environment setup is ready! Team members can now:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./setup.sh`
3. Start developing with `./start-dev.sh`

The setup handles everything automatically and provides clear instructions for any manual steps needed.
