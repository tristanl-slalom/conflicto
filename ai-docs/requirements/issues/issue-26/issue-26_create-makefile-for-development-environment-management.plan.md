# Implementation Plan: Create Makefile for Development Environment Management

**GitHub Issue:** [#26](https://github.com/tristanl-slalom/conflicto/issues/26)
**Generated:** October 7, 2025

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation will create a comprehensive Makefile that serves as the central hub for all development operations on the Caja platform. The approach prioritizes developer experience, cross-platform compatibility, and integration with existing tooling. The Makefile will provide both individual component commands and orchestrated workflows for full-stack development.

## File Structure Changes

### New Files to Create
```
/workspaces/conflicto/
├── Makefile                    # Main development Makefile
├── .dev-processes/             # Process tracking directory (created at runtime)
└── docs/MAKEFILE.md           # Detailed Makefile documentation
```

### Existing Files to Modify
```
/workspaces/conflicto/
├── README.md                  # Add Makefile usage section
└── .gitignore                 # Add .dev-processes/ to ignore list
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Core Makefile Structure
**Files:** `/Makefile`

- Expand the existing Makefile with proper shell configuration and variable definitions
- Define configurable environment variables (ports, directories, tools)
- Implement help target with comprehensive target documentation
- Add cross-platform compatibility helpers and utility functions

### Step 2: Implement Server Management Commands
**Files:** `/Makefile`

- `start-backend`: Start FastAPI server using uvicorn with development settings
- `start-frontend`: Start React development server using Vite
- `start-all`: Launch both servers in background with PID tracking
- `stop-all`: Gracefully terminate all tracked processes
- `restart-all`: Sequential stop and start operations
- `status`: Display current status of development servers

### Step 3: Add Testing Infrastructure
**Files:** `/Makefile`

- `test-backend`: Execute pytest with coverage reporting and proper configuration
- `test-frontend`: Run Jest/RTL tests with TypeScript support
- `test-all`: Orchestrate complete test suite execution
- `test-watch`: Enable watch mode for active development
- `test-coverage`: Generate and display comprehensive coverage reports

### Step 4: Create Development Utilities
**Files:** `/Makefile`

We need things that do these commands, but evaluate strongly the commands that we have for overlap. Make them match the below when there are deviations.

- `install`: Master installation command for all dependencies
- `install-backend`: Poetry-based Python dependency installation
- `install-frontend`: npm/yarn-based Node.js dependency installation
- `lint`: Comprehensive linting for both codebases
- `format`: Auto-formatting using Black and Prettier
- `clean`: Cleanup of build artifacts, cache files, and temporary data
- `setup`: Complete initial development environment configuration

### Step 5: Implement Process Management System
**Files:** `/Makefile`

- Create `.dev-processes/` directory management
- PID file creation and tracking for background processes
- Process health checking and status reporting
- Graceful shutdown handling with timeout mechanisms
- Process log management and rotation

### Step 6: Add Error Handling and Validation
**Files:** `/Makefile`

- Directory existence validation (backend/, frontend/)
- Dependency availability checking (Poetry, Node.js, etc.)
- Port availability verification before server startup
- Clear error messages with actionable remediation steps
- Fallback options for different development environments

### Step 7: Create Documentation
**Files:** `/docs/MAKEFILE.md`, `/README.md`

- Comprehensive Makefile documentation with usage examples
- Update main README.md with Makefile integration section
- Common workflow examples and troubleshooting guide
- IDE integration instructions for VS Code and other editors

### Step 8: Add .gitignore Updates
**Files:** `/.gitignore`

- Add `.dev-processes/` directory to Git ignore list
- Include other temporary files created by Makefile operations
- Ensure no PID files or process logs are tracked in version control

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing for Makefile Targets
- Create test scripts to validate each Makefile target
- Test server startup and shutdown operations
- Verify PID tracking and process management
- Validate cross-platform compatibility on different systems

### Integration Testing
- Test complete development workflows (setup → start → test → stop)
- Verify integration with existing Poetry and npm configurations
- Test error handling scenarios (missing dependencies, port conflicts)
- Validate performance with concurrent operations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Fresh environment setup using `make setup`
- [ ] Server management operations (`start-all`, `stop-all`, `restart-all`)
- [ ] Test execution with coverage reporting
- [ ] Code formatting and linting operations
- [ ] Cleanup operations and artifact removal
- [ ] Help documentation accuracy and completeness

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Requirements
- GNU Make 3.8+ (available on most development systems)
- Python 3.11+ with Poetry installed
- Node.js 23+ with npm or yarn
- POSIX-compliant shell for cross-platform support

### Configuration Management
- Environment variables for customization (ports, paths, tools)
- Automatic detection of available package managers (npm vs yarn)
- Graceful fallback when optional tools are unavailable
- Integration with existing project configuration files

### Integration with Existing Workflows
- Align with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline commands
- Maintain compatibility with existing development scripts
- Support both containerized and native development environments
- Integrate with VS Code workspace configuration

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues and Mitigation Strategies

**Risk:** Port conflicts with other development services
- **Mitigation:** Port availability checking before server startup
- **Fallback:** Configurable port numbers via environment variables

**Risk:** Background process management failures
- **Mitigation:** Robust PID tracking with health checks
- **Fallback:** Manual process cleanup instructions in error messages

**Risk:** Cross-platform compatibility issues
- **Mitigation:** POSIX-compliant shell commands and thorough testing
- **Fallback:** Platform-specific command variants where necessary

**Risk:** Dependency conflicts with existing tooling
- **Mitigation:** Use existing project configurations (pyproject.toml, package.json)
- **Fallback:** Clear error messages directing to manual configuration

**Risk:** Performance impact on development workflow
- **Mitigation:** Optimize for common operations and provide progress feedback
- **Fallback:** Individual component commands for granular control

## Estimated Effort

### Time Estimation
- **Makefile Core Implementation:** 4-6 hours
- **Testing and Validation:** 2-3 hours
- **Documentation Creation:** 2-3 hours
- **Integration Testing:** 2-3 hours
- **Total Estimated Effort:** 10-15 hours

### Complexity Assessment
- **Low Complexity:** Basic target definitions and variable setup
- **Medium Complexity:** Process management and PID tracking
- **High Complexity:** Cross-platform compatibility and error handling
- **Overall Complexity:** Medium

### Dependencies and Blockers
- Requires understanding of existing Poetry and npm configurations
- Need access to development environment for testing
- May require coordination with team for testing across different platforms
- Documentation updates may need review by team leads
