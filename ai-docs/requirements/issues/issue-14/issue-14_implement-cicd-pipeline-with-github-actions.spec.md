# Technical Specification: Implement CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

**GitHub Issue:** [#14](https://github.com/tristanl-slalom/conflicto/issues/14)
**Generated:** 2025-10-07T19:20:00Z

## Problem Statement

The Conflicto development team needs automated testing and deployment pipelines to ensure code quality, catch issues early in the development cycle, and enable reliable deployments to staging and production environments. Currently, testing and deployment processes are manual, leading to potential inconsistencies and delayed feedback loops.

## Technical Requirements

### Core CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

1. **Automated Testing Pipeline**
   - Unit tests for backend FastAPI application
   - Integration tests for database operations and API endpoints
   - Frontend component tests using Jest/React Testing Library
   - End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
   - Test coverage reporting and quality gates

2. **Build and Package Management**
   - Docker image building for backend services
   - Frontend static asset compilation and optimization
   - Multi-stage Docker builds for production efficiency
   - Container registry management (ECR integration)

3. **Security and Quality Assurance**
   - Code quality analysis and linting enforcement
   - Infrastructure security validation
   - Secrets management and secure credential handling

## Out of Scope

1. **Deployment Automation**
   - Deployment automation will come from future issues
   - Ignore any references to deployments for now within this issue

## API Specifications

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Pull Request Workflow (`pr-checks.yml`)
```yaml
# Triggers on: pull_request events
# Jobs: test-backend, test-frontend, security-scan, build-validation
# Outputs: test results, coverage reports, security scan results
```

#### Main Branch Workflow (`deploy-staging.yml`)
```yaml
# Triggers on: push to main branch
# Jobs: build-images, integration-tests
# Outputs: image build results, test results
```

### Workflow Job Specifications

#### Backend Testing Job
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Services:** PostgreSQL 15, Redis
- **Steps:** Setup Python 3.12, install dependencies, run pytest suite
- **Artifacts:** Test coverage reports, pytest results

#### Frontend Testing Job
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Node Version:** 22.x
- **Steps:** Setup Node, install dependencies, run Jest/Vitest
- **Artifacts:** Test coverage, build artifacts

#### Security Scanning Job
- **Tools:** Snyk, Trivy, CodeQL
- **Scope:** Dependency vulnerabilities, container scanning, code analysis
- **Outputs:** Security reports, SARIF results

## Data Models

### Workflow Configuration Schema

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow metadata
name: string
on:
  push: { branches: string[] }
  pull_request: { types: string[] }
  workflow_dispatch: object

jobs:
  job_id:
    runs-on: string
    strategy: { matrix: object }
    steps: step[]
    outputs: { key: string }

# Step configuration
step:
  name: string
  uses?: string  # for actions
  run?: string   # for commands
  with?: object  # action inputs
  env?: object   # environment variables
```

### Environment Configuration

```yaml
# Environment-specific settings
environments:
  staging:
    url: https://staging.conflicto.app
    aws_account: "staging-account-id"
    database_size: small

  production:
    url: https://conflicto.app
    aws_account: "prod-account-id"
    database_size: large
    approval_required: true
```

## Infrastructure Integration Points

### AWS Services Integration
- **ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** Docker image storage and management
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service):** Container orchestration for deployments
- **Application Load Balancer:** Traffic routing and health checks
- **CloudWatch:** Monitoring, logging, and alerting integration
- **Parameter Store/Secrets Manager:** Secure configuration management

### Third-Party Services
- **GitHub Actions:** Primary CI/CD orchestration platform
- **Snyk:** Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL:** Static application security testing (SAST)
- **Trivy:** Container image and filesystem security scanning

## Integration Points

### Repository Integration
- **Branch Protection Rules:** Enforce CI checks before merge
- **Status Checks:** Required passing tests and security scans
- **Auto-merge:** Dependabot PRs with passing checks

### Notification Integration
- **Slack:** Build status notifications to development channels
- **Email:** Critical failure alerts to on-call team
- **GitHub:** PR status updates and deployment notifications

## Acceptance Criteria

### CI Pipeline Acceptance Criteria
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows trigger automatically on PR creation
- [x] All backend unit and integration tests execute and report results
- [x] All frontend component and integration tests execute successfully
- [x] Security scanning identifies and reports vulnerabilities
- [x] Build artifacts are created and validated for all components
- [x] Test coverage reports are generated and meet minimum thresholds (80%)

### CD Pipeline Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Successful merges to main branch trigger final checks and image building

### Quality and Security Criteria
- [x] Code quality gates prevent merging of substandard code
- [x] Dependency vulnerabilities are identified and managed
- [x] Infrastructure configurations are validated before deployment
- [x] Secrets and credentials are managed securely throughout pipeline

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Technical Assumptions
- GitHub Actions is approved platform for CI/CD operations
- AWS is the target cloud platform for all deployments
- Docker containerization is standard for all service deployments
- PostgreSQL and Redis are standard data layer components

### Security Constraints
- All secrets must be stored in GitHub Secrets or AWS Parameter Store
- Container images must pass security scanning before deployment
- Audit trails must be maintained for all deployment activities

### Performance Constraints
- CI pipeline must complete within 10 minutes for standard PRs
- Deployment to staging must complete within 5 minutes
- Production deployments must complete within 15 minutes

### Resource Constraints
- GitHub Actions concurrent job limits (20 concurrent jobs)
- AWS service limits for ECR storage and ECS capacity
- Build artifact retention (30 days for staging, 90 days for production)
- Cost optimization targets for compute and storage resources
