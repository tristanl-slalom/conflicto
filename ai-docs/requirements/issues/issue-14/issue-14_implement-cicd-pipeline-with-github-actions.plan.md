# Implementation Plan: Implement CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

**GitHub Issue:** [#14](https://github.com/tristanl-slalom/conflicto/issues/14)
**Generated:** 2025-10-07T19:20:00Z

## Implementation Strategy

The CI/CD pipeline implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with basic automated testing and building up to full deployment automation. The strategy prioritizes quick feedback loops for developers while ensuring production stability and security.

**Phase 1:** Core CI pipeline with automated testing
**Phase 2:** Build automation and artifact management
**Phase 3:** Staging deployment automation
**Phase 4:** Production deployment with approval gates
**Phase 5:** Advanced monitoring and optimization

1. Create reusable backend setup action with Python 3.12 and dependencies
2. Configure pytest for CI environment with parallel execution
3. Set up coverage reporting with minimum threshold enforcement
4. Add database migration testing with test database
5. Integrate backend testing into PR workflow

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

### Step 3: Frontend CI Pipeline
**Files:** `.github/actions/setup-frontend/`, `frontend/vitest.config.ts`, `jest.config.js`

1. Create reusable frontend setup action with Node.js 18
2. Configure Vitest and Jest for CI environment
3. Set up component testing with React Testing Library
4. Add build validation and asset optimization testing
5. Integrate frontend testing into PR workflow

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### Step 4: Security and Quality Integration
**Files:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`, `docker/*/Dockerfile.ci`

1. Integrate Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning
2. Set up Trivy for container image security scanning
3. Configure CodeQL for static application security testing
4. Add Docker image building and scanning to workflow
5. Create quality gates for security and coverage thresholds

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours

### Step 5: Staging Deployment Automation
**Files:** `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`, `.github/actions/deploy-to-aws/`

1. Create staging deployment workflow triggered on main branch push
2. Build and push Docker images to ECR with proper tagging
3. Deploy to staging ECS service with health checks
4. Run smoke tests against staging environment
5. Add deployment status reporting and notifications

**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Migrations
- Automated migration execution in staging environment
- Migration validation and rollback procedures
- Production migration approval and execution process
- Migration testing with realistic data volumes

### Environment Configuration

- Error tracking and alerting for deployment failures
- Performance monitoring and optimization recommendations
- Audit logging for all deployment activities

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
**Deployment Failures:** Comprehensive testing and rollback automation
**Security Vulnerabilities:** Multi-layer security scanning and validation
**Performance Impact:** Gradual rollout and performance monitoring
**Configuration Drift:** Infrastructure as code and validation automation

### Mitigation Strategies
**Staging Environment Parity:** Ensure staging matches production configuration
**Incremental Rollout:** Feature flags and canary deployment capabilities
**Monitoring and Alerting:** Proactive issue detection and resolution
**Documentation:** Comprehensive troubleshooting and recovery procedures

### Contingency Plans
**Pipeline Failures:** Manual deployment procedures and emergency processes
**AWS Service Outages:** Multi-region failover and disaster recovery
**Security Incidents:** Automated rollback and incident response procedures
**Performance Degradation:** Automatic scaling and traffic management

## Estimated Effort

### Total Implementation Time: 25-32 hours

**Infrastructure Setup:** 6-8 hours
- GitHub Actions configuration and AWS integration
- IAM roles, ECR repositories, and security setup

**CI Pipeline Development:** 12-15 hours
- Backend and frontend testing automation
- Security scanning and quality gate implementation
- Docker image building and validation

**CD Pipeline Development:** 7-9 hours

- Documentation and troubleshooting guides

### Complexity Assessment

**Medium-High Complexity**
- Requires expertise in GitHub Actions, AWS services, and container orchestration
- Integration with existing infrastructure and development workflows
- Security and compliance requirements add complexity
- Multi-environment deployment coordination

**Dependencies**
- AWS infrastructure must be provisioned and accessible
- GitHub repository permissions and secrets configuration
- Development team coordination for testing and validation
- Security team approval for production deployment procedures

**Success Metrics**
- 100% automated testing coverage for all PRs
- Sub-10 minute CI pipeline execution time
