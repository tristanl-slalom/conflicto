## Brief Description
Establish the foundational FastAPI application structure to support session and activity management APIs for the Caja live event engagement platform.

## Problem Statement
The Caja platform requires a robust backend foundation to manage sessions, activities, and participants. This includes creating the basic application structure, database models, API endpoints, and supporting infrastructure for the live event engagement system.

## Technical Requirements

### Application Structure
- FastAPI application with proper project structure and modularization
- Python 3.11+ compatibility
- Proper dependency injection and configuration management
- Environment-based configuration support
- Health check endpoints for containerization

### Database Requirements
- PostgreSQL database integration using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Proper database connection pooling and session management
- Migration support using Alembic
- Database models for core entities: sessions, activities, participants

### API Specifications
- RESTful API endpoints following OpenAPI standards
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- API versioning strategy

### Data Models
```python
# Core entity relationships
Session:
  - id: UUID (primary key)
  - name: string
  - status: enum ('draft', 'active', 'completed')
  - created_at: datetime
  - admin_id: string
  - activities: relationship to Activity[]

Activity:
  - id: UUID (primary key)
  - session_id: UUID (foreign key)
  - type: enum ('poll', 'poker', 'quiz', 'wordcloud')
  - config: JSON (activity-specific configuration)
  - order: integer
  - status: enum ('draft', 'active', 'expired')

Participant:
  - id: UUID (primary key, session-scoped)
  - session_id: UUID (foreign key)
  - nickname: string
  - joined_at: datetime
  - last_activity: datetime
```

### Interface Requirements
- Session CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Activity management within sessions
- Participant registration and management
- Real-time state polling endpoints
- Session lifecycle management (draft → active → completed)

### Integration Points
- Docker containerization for ECS deployment
- AWS RDS PostgreSQL database connection
- CloudWatch logging integration
- Health check endpoints for load balancer
- Environment variable configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- FastAPI application runs locally and in Docker containers
- Database schema supports complete session lifecycle management
- All API endpoints are documented with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Comprehensive test coverage using pytest
- Code passes quality checks (linting, type checking)
- Session, activity, and participant management fully functional
- Database migrations work correctly
- Error handling provides meaningful feedback
- Logging structured for CloudWatch integration

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Using PostgreSQL as primary database (not SQLite for production)
- Session-based temporary user management (no permanent accounts)
- Polling-based real-time updates (no WebSocket requirement initially)
- Single FastAPI application (not microservices architecture)
- Anonymous participant support with nickname-based identification
