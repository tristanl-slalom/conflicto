# Technical Specification: Implement Static Site Generation and S3 Deployment for Frontend

**GitHub Issue:** [#44](https://github.com/tristanl-slalom/conflicto/issues/44)
**Generated:** October 7, 2025

## Problem Statement

The frontend application currently runs as a development server without a proper production deployment strategy. The goal is to enable Single Page Application (SPA) mode for the frontend using TanStack Start and configure it for static site generation, which will improve performance and reduce deployment costs.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **SPA Configuration**: Configure TanStack Start for SPA generation mode
2. **Build Optimization**: Update Vite configuration for SPA optimization
3. **Static Build Generation**: Ensure `npm run build` generates proper static files
4. **Route Handling**: All routes must render properly in static mode
5. **API Integration**: Maintain proper API call functionality in static build

### Performance Requirements
- Static assets should be optimized for caching
- Bundle size should be minimized for fast loading
- Routes should support client-side navigation

### Compatibility Requirements
- Support all existing routes in the application
- Maintain compatibility with existing TanStack Router configuration
- Ensure API calls continue to work with backend services

## API Specifications

No new API endpoints required. The implementation must maintain compatibility with existing API calls to the backend services running on different ports/domains.

### API Integration Considerations
- Configure proper base URLs for API calls in production
- Handle CORS configurations if needed
- Ensure API client generation (Orval) continues to work

## Data Models

No new data models required. The implementation focuses on build and deployment configuration.

## Interface Requirements

### Build Output Structure
```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── assets/
│   ├── *.js           # JavaScript bundles
│   ├── *.css          # Stylesheet bundles
│   └── *.png/svg/ico  # Static assets
└── favicon.ico        # Favicon
```

### Configuration Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration for SPA mode
- `package.json` - Updated build scripts
- TanStack Start configuration files

## Integration Points

### TanStack Start Integration
- Configure for SPA generation mode
- Ensure proper route handling for static builds
- Maintain compatibility with existing router configuration

### Vite Integration
- Optimize build configuration for static sites
- Configure asset handling and optimization
- Set up proper base path configuration

### CI/CD Integration (Future)
- Build process should be compatible with automated deployment
- Generate artifacts suitable for S3 static hosting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [ ] Frontend builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] All existing routes render properly in static build
- [ ] API calls work properly from static build
- [ ] Static files are properly optimized and cacheable

### Technical Criteria
- [ ] TanStack Start configured for SPA generation
- [ ] Vite configuration optimized for static builds
- [ ] Package.json scripts updated appropriately
- [ ] Build output is deployment-ready

### Quality Criteria
- [ ] Build process is reliable and repeatable
- [ ] No broken links or missing assets
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Development workflow remains intact

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- Current TanStack Start and Vite versions support SPA generation
- Existing routing structure is compatible with static generation
- API endpoints will remain accessible from static deployment
- No server-side rendering (SSR) requirements

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with development workflow
- Cannot break existing functionality during transition
- Build process should be fast and efficient
- Final deployment target will be S3 static hosting (Phase 2)

### Technical Limitations
- Client-side routing only (no server-side routing)
- Static assets only (no server-side processing)
- API calls must be handled client-side
- Build-time data fetching limitations

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing frontend codebase structure
- Current TanStack Router configuration
- API client generation setup (Orval)
- Existing component library and styling

### External Dependencies
- TanStack Start framework
- Vite build tool
- Node.js and npm ecosystem
- Backend API services

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk
- **Route Configuration**: Complex routes may need adjustment for static generation
- **API Base URLs**: Production API endpoints need proper configuration
- **Asset Loading**: Dynamic imports and lazy loading may need verification

### Low Risk
- **Build Performance**: Standard Vite optimizations should handle performance
- **Development Workflow**: Changes should be minimal and backward compatible

## Success Metrics

1. **Build Success Rate**: 100% successful builds
2. **Route Coverage**: All existing routes functional in static build
3. **API Connectivity**: All API integrations working properly
4. **Performance**: Build time under 2 minutes, bundle size optimized
5. **Developer Experience**: No degradation in development workflow
