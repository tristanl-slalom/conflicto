# Technical Specification: Remove duplicate shell script files from root directory

**GitHub Issue:** [#30](https://github.com/tristanl-slalom/conflicto/issues/30)
**Generated:** 2025-10-07T17:28:00Z

## Problem Statement

The root directory contains duplicate shell script files that create confusion and maintenance overhead. These scripts (`reset-db.sh`, `run-tests.sh`, `start-dev.sh`, `stop-dev.sh`) are superseded by improved versions in the `backend/` directory that include better error handling, logging, validation, and Docker availability checks.

## Technical Requirements

### Files to Remove
- `/reset-db.sh`
- `/run-tests.sh`
- `/start-dev.sh`
- `/stop-dev.sh`

### Pre-removal Validation Requirements
1. **Backend Script Verification**: Confirm all functionality exists in `backend/` directory versions
2. **Reference Analysis**: Scan codebase for any dependencies on root-level scripts
3. **Documentation Check**: Verify no documentation references root-level scripts
4. **Build Tool Analysis**: Ensure Makefile and CI/CD don't depend on root-level scripts

### Post-removal Validation
1. **Functionality Preservation**: All operations must remain available through backend scripts
2. **Documentation Updates**: Update any references to point to backend scripts
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear guidance on using backend scripts instead

## API Specifications

Not applicable - this is a cleanup task with no API changes.

## Data Models

Not applicable - no database or data model changes required.

## Interface Requirements

### Command Line Interface Changes
- Remove root-level script execution paths
- Preserve all functionality through `backend/` directory scripts
- Maintain backward compatibility through documentation

## Integration Points

### Makefile Integration
- Verify Makefile targets don't reference root-level scripts directly
- Update any Makefile commands if necessary to use backend scripts

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- Check GitHub Actions workflows for script references
- Update workflow commands if they reference root-level scripts

### Development Workflow Integration
- Update development setup documentation
- Ensure script discovery remains intuitive for developers

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [ ] All four duplicate shell scripts removed from root directory
- [ ] All functionality remains available through backend scripts
- [ ] No broken references in codebase or documentation
- [ ] Development workflows continue to function correctly

### Technical Criteria
- [ ] No syntax errors or broken imports after removal
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines continue to pass
- [ ] All script functionality validated in backend directory
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects script locations

### Quality Criteria
- [ ] Root directory cleaner and less confusing
- [ ] Clear documentation on which scripts to use
- [ ] No maintenance burden from duplicate scripts
- [ ] Developer onboarding remains smooth

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
1. Backend scripts provide equivalent or better functionality than root scripts
2. No external tools or processes depend on root-level script paths
3. Team members are comfortable navigating to backend directory for scripts
4. Documentation can be updated to reflect script location changes

### Constraints
1. Must maintain all existing functionality
2. Cannot break existing developer workflows
3. Must preserve script execution capabilities
4. Cannot introduce additional complexity for common operations

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Script removal should not affect security posture
- Backend scripts maintain same permission requirements
- No privilege escalation or reduction from file removal

### Audit Trail
- Document removal in commit messages
- Maintain git history for reference
- Clear reasoning in pull request description

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- Reduced directory scanning time
- Fewer files to maintain and update
- Clearer project structure for new developers

### No Negative Impacts Expected
- Script execution performance unchanged (using backend scripts)
- Development workflow speed maintained
- Build process performance unaffected
