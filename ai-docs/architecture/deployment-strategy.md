- **Caching Strategies:** Optimized for static and dynamic content

## Deployment Environments

### Development Environment
- **Purpose:** Feature development and testing
- **Resources:** Smaller instance sizes, single AZ
- **Database:** Smaller RDS instance with automated backups
- **Domain:** dev.caja.example.com
- **Monitoring:** Basic CloudWatch metrics

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose:** Pre-production testing and validation
- **Resources:** Production-equivalent setup
- **Database:** Multi-AZ with production-like data volume
- **Domain:** staging.caja.example.com
- **Monitoring:** Full monitoring suite with alerts

### Production Environment
- **Purpose:** Live application serving real users
- **Resources:** Auto-scaling, high availability configuration
- **Database:** Multi-AZ with backup retention and monitoring
- **Domain:** caja.example.com
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and logging

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Code Quality & Testing
```yaml
- Lint and format checking (Black, Flake8, MyPy)
- Unit test execution with coverage reporting
- Integration test suite against test database
- Security scanning (dependency vulnerabilities)
- Docker image building and scanning
```

#### 2. Infrastructure Validation
```yaml
- Terraform format and validation
- Terraform plan generation and review
- Infrastructure security scanning
- Cost estimation for resource changes
```

#### 3. Application Deployment
```yaml
- Container image push to ECR
- ECS service update with rolling deployment
- Health check validation post-deployment
- Smoke tests against deployed endpoints
```

#### 4. Monitoring & Validation
```yaml
- CloudWatch alarm validation
- Performance benchmark execution
- End-to-end test suite
- Rollback procedures if validation fails
```

### Deployment Strategies

#### Rolling Deployment (Default)
- **Process:** Gradual replacement of running tasks
- **Advantages:** Zero downtime, automatic rollback
- **Use Case:** Standard application updates
- **Monitoring:** Health checks ensure successful deployment

#### Blue-Green Deployment (Critical Updates)
- **Process:** Complete environment swap
- **Advantages:** Instant rollback, full validation
- **Use Case:** Major version updates, schema changes
- **Implementation:** ECS service replacement with load balancer switch

    └── prod/             # Production environment
```

### State Management
- **Remote State:** S3 backend with DynamoDB locking
- **State Isolation:** Separate state files per environment
- **Access Control:** IAM policies for state bucket access
- **Versioning:** S3 versioning for state file history

### Resource Management
- **Naming Conventions:** Environment and service prefixes
- **Tagging Strategy:** Cost allocation and resource organization
- **Resource Limits:** Prevent accidental over-provisioning
- **Change Management:** Terraform plan review process

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring
- **CloudWatch Metrics:** Custom application metrics
- **CloudWatch Logs:** Structured JSON logging
- **X-Ray Tracing:** Request tracing for performance analysis
- **Health Checks:** ECS and ALB health monitoring

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **EC2 Metrics:** CPU, memory, network utilization
- **RDS Monitoring:** Database performance and connections
- **ELB Metrics:** Request latency and error rates
- **CloudFront Metrics:** CDN performance and cache hit rates

### Alerting Strategy
- **Critical Alerts:** Service down, database connection failures
- **Warning Alerts:** High CPU, increased latency, error rate spikes
- **Information Alerts:** Deployment completions, scaling events
- **Escalation:** PagerDuty integration for after-hours incidents

## Security & Compliance

### Network Security
- **WAF Integration:** CloudFront web application firewall
- **DDoS Protection:** CloudFront and Route 53 built-in protection
- **VPC Flow Logs:** Network traffic monitoring
- **Security Groups:** Restrictive ingress/egress rules

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest:** RDS encryption, S3 encryption
- **Encryption in Transit:** SSL/TLS for all communications
- **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager integration
- **Key Management:** AWS KMS for encryption key management

### Access Control
- **IAM Roles:** Service-specific permissions
- **Resource Policies:** Bucket and database access controls
- **MFA Requirements:** Administrative access protection
- **Audit Logging:** CloudTrail for all API activities

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database Backups:** Automated RDS backups with 7-day retention
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Up to backup retention period
- **Cross-Region Replication:** Critical data replication
- **Application State:** Stateless design minimizes recovery complexity

### Recovery Procedures
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** 1 hour for production services
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** 15 minutes for database
- **Failover Process:** Automated Multi-AZ failover for RDS
- **Testing:** Monthly disaster recovery testing

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Optimization
- **Auto Scaling:** ECS services scale based on demand
- **Spot Instances:** Development environments use Spot pricing
- **Reserved Instances:** Production RDS instances reserved
- **S3 Lifecycle:** Automated transition to cheaper storage classes

### Monitoring & Control
- **Cost Budgets:** AWS Budget alerts for spending limits
- **Resource Tagging:** Detailed cost allocation tracking
- **Regular Reviews:** Monthly cost optimization reviews
- **Right-sizing:** Continuous monitoring for oversized resources

This deployment strategy ensures scalable, secure, and cost-effective hosting while maintaining high availability and performance for the Caja live event engagement platform.
