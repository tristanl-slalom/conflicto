OK, alright, we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out in a little bit. I'm gonna let it run here for a minute. Also, don't sleep on the copilot CLI tool like that thing's gonna pull over.
What is the copilot CLI tool? They get them and cursor each created a CLI that works pretty much exactly like cloud code and and is that recent? Like in the last couple of weeks? OK, I was using the cursor when I've Muret has to suggest a screenshot. I was using the CLI time.
Oh, I was like struggling with the team. I was trying to use cursor and I like, I'm so stupid with it because I'm so used to using Vim and I'm like, where do I use my mouse? How do I use files and stuff? And then eventually I just installed the CLI tool and I was like, oh, this actually like feels OK, I can use Vim again.
We'll have to talk about your your VIN addiction later. I feel like such a derp whenever I use Visual Studio Code. Like I'm so used to just working in like with my keyboard. It's in preview the GitHub Copilot. Yeah, it is. It works fine, yeah.
And I had MJ activate that last week for us, so we we got it. I think it looks neat. Some people like I've never used the CLI yet, so like I wouldn't mind doing it now. It's just like I'll be mostly watching while someone else is driving, which is fine. I think it's just like a different type of workload that some people enjoy and some people don't. It's more just like.
It's more like background operations rather, right? So like you can, you can build your workflow around that or you can work out of the ID, which is a lot more like tailored to what people expect, right? So.
I think there's different types and the real power users, like if you go see Ryan work, there's this, there's this combo that like a lot of people in the industry really like, which is to use cursor and then have cloud code running in the CLI from inside of cursor. That's a lot of people. That's what I've been doing. Yeah, exactly. On my personal projects is I have.
I basically have uh windsurf and then I have uh cloud code in the terminal. Yeah, that that that like. So it's true that you can achieve the same thing with any tool or tools. It's also true that each tool does particular things.
Quite a bit better than each other in their specific space. So like hyper tailored workflows that are like I use plug for this and I use cursor for that will exist and do exist and that's how some people are gonna operate. More people like me are gonna be like I just have my one tool and I'm just gonna like.
Figure everything out for that tool. That's perfectly fine. Well, what's interesting as well is like using sort of the LLM as a judge kind of pattern is you're using one tool as a reviewer for the output of another tool, which allows you to just not.
Pollute the memory side of things either and say, hey, if you didn't have any other context and we're just looking at this code base for example. So I did that for a personal project. I implemented an initial version of it and I wasn't happy with it and I said I.
Took another tool and I said have a look at this thing that I created and give me a critique of it and next steps that should be taken. Basically an implementation plan and then go execute on that implementation plan and you can it's a good way to do things too. That's exactly what Ryan does. He has a lot of his hands on working cursor and he has all these backgrounds.
Own agents in cloud code and he'll just be like, hey agent, uh, go run tests or something like that. Like there's a bunch of weird, weird little workflows. I'm not that kind of person, but.
Cool. All right. Y'all good. Enjoy. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Off we go.
Alright.
All right, so.
So I think in in our.
Embracing of trying to accelerate as many aspects of it. I think what would be good for the next step is we just have an open discussion around what some of the requirements we might want for Gaja de conflicto.
CCD. No, CDC. Oh no, no, no, not CDC. Anyway, just Kaha, just Kaha. Keep it simple. I think we should just say just Kaha. And so we can do that. Then we can feed that into.
You know, either version of Copilot, either Office Copilot or GitHub Copilot, then we can and maybe this is where we start having a conversation about the pipeline, right? So if you want to have a pipeline and we say we start here with, let's just call it requirement discussion.
And then we're going to go through a number of steps.
Unfortunately.
I'll just make a oops a note here. Do not forget about non functional requirements. Sure, summarize that context. Yeah. And so here at some at some point here we wanna get to working code.
Or maybe we want to get to V0 of working code, right? So what are the steps that we think we need here just at a high level, right? So we're going to have a requirements discussion, then we're going to use an LLM to turn that into what?
So we could create like the thing that I've seen pretty successful with one MCP. It's just like interacting with GitHub both for evaluating other repos and calculating, but also to like put your requirements as individual.
Issues on the repo. So like, they could be just even if there's no existing code. Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. OK.
Just we're just laying out what we want the app to do as issues, as issues and what's the relationship of those issues to user stories one to one.
Interesting. Yeah, yeah. Using issues as a place to gather like here is a thing that this app needs to do. OK, this is the acceptance criteria for this issue to be closed. OK, so my only concern with that would be we're going from a high level discussion to user stories and it seems like maybe we're missing.
A couple of things in the middle that are like we want user stories to be grouped in some way in features or epics or something like that. Yeah, I mean, yes, like the thing that it did was tag them with epics. It would define tags for the sure for the.
Buckets of those things.
The formalized definitions of those tags could be in the context of sure. So let me help me understand. So an issue in GitHub could either be an epic or a feature or a user story or I think it is really.
Just like or a tag. A tag is used just to organize them. But there's no, there's no. So the way that I think of the feature. OK, all right, let me back up. So the way that in my experience, and this is not saying we have to do it this way, right? Yeah, I'm a I'm a 1.9. I remember. I don't remember what. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm happy. Yeah, I'm. Let's work together, right in in my experience.
Asking the LLM to do things more incrementally yields a better results and B, it gives us more chances to have a human review in the middle, human in the loop, right? Yep. So the way that I would think about it is we have a free flowing conversation. We feed that.
That transcript into the LLM, we get something out of it that is maybe short of actual user stories because that would that's going all the way to basically almost a work item, right? But we go maybe into a set of features that are high level definitions.
And then we review those features and we go, yay, nay, you know, manually adjust some of those. And then we take those features and we come up with user stories off of those features. I don't know what that is. I don't know.
Does that make sense? Yeah, in between stuff. So, right. So we're taking all of our talking of requirements. Yeah, we're gonna synthesize. I would think we would synthesize those into artifact like we just did with the repo. We just took all of our things and we laid out this processed file that contains basically an intro about what our app is doing.
Supposed to be and how it's supposed to be built. Now we can go into further requirements, not requirements, but like further discussion about the features of our application and do the same, bring that into the repo as an artifact. But yeah, but in the way that we asked to bring it into the repo is as.
Vitual features, Yeah. So make sense of this conversation that jump from here to here to here to here. Mm-hmm. Build that into a set of features, yeah.
And then we can combine the set of features that we just came up with, with whatever you call the other thing. The thing is the no, the thing that you just created. Uh, what did you call that intro? Oh yeah, yeah, the.
I haven't figured out where it finally put this thing. Uh, it's in a folder called process right now, but it's like half goals. So, but So what I like about that is we are now in, we are now incrementally building context. Mm-hmm. That's a little bit more.
Hi res about the thing that we wanna build, but we're not losing that context, right? Yeah. So we took an hour worth of conversation here, one hour, and we turned it into gold, which is whatever, 200 lines of text, right? And then we're gonna take another hour of conversation, we're gonna turn it.
Features. And then we can combine these two things and then turn that into stories. Yep.
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. OK, so we have this is LLM LLM here, we have LLM here, and then this is gonna be HR, which is human review. Yes, right. So we're gonna review that, we're gonna potentially manually change it or update it or whatever and then.
We're gonna use a prompt again to go into user stories and then at that point we have our user stories and now what do we wanna feed our user stories into straight into an agent and say go implement this or I think we should have leading question. I wasn't suggesting that that's what we do.
No, yeah, we shouldn't. We should also define like the the approach that we want the system to take as it crunches through these. Yeah, so it's almost like to me there is a a logical line here.
In the sense that up to this point, we've basically been in discovery, yeah, requirements.
And now we're about to enter delivery land. Yeah, where we're gonna define what the approach is for building software as if we were trying to teach an entry level career engineer. Welcome to Caja. This is where we never went back to our stack discussion.
Where we discuss our stack and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. OK. So I think that's a good starting point here. We can when we after we break for this, we can get into delivery and get more into stack, but that's good. And then I think we can just use GitHub Copilot for these steps here.
Right now, without really overthinking it too much. Great. And then maybe we can think about our tooling.
Yeah, I I want to learn a little bit more about how open code works to see if that's the thing that we could use. But I think it would be cool if that was the thing that we could use. And if it like, so do you time box that exploration or like is there some point where we're just like, well, we all have copilot, we could just use copilot.
So good question. So we all have copilot in VS code. Is that a true statement? Mm-hmm. Right. OK.
I think let's just default, you know, in the in the name of Yagni. Let's just, you know, default to what we have. Explain what you ain't gonna need it. Yeah, OK, let's just use what we have and then see if there's something in particular that we missed, what I'm anticipating missing.
From Copilot and maybe it's there, I just don't know about it. It is orchestration and the ability to get here and say, OK, now we have, let's just say for example, we have, we end up with 7 features. Yep. And we end up with 27 user stories. Yep.
Right. And we have. So I don't know with Copilot, I don't know how to give it a cloud dot MD, which is basically a set of instructions that's going to apply to all of the work. I don't know how to do that. So yeah, that's we got, we got ways.
OK. In fact, I think like compared to cursor, I think cursor operates sounds like the same as Claude where we've got like a single file where we layout all of our rules and things. But like in GitHub Copilot, you can get very granular. Um, right. Like, but. And it's good to be able to get granular. Yeah, if we had something.
So like the introduction to the project, right? Introduction to the project to GitHub Copilot. Do we have a way to do that and say this is a project that's going to use Python? You know this library for API, that's going to use this library for testing.
Of the API. It's gonna use this library to talk to the database. It's gonna be based on this cloud. It's gonna, you know, like these are the directions for the entire project. That context is for everybody. Yep, Yep, Yep. Totally possible. Yeah. OK. Do you know how physically or? OK, yeah, cool. How you tell copilot?
Create these rules in VS code. Well, yeah, how are they? How are they? It's like a copilot folder. OK, that contains. There you go. OK, that's the answer. Yeah, copilot.md as like the start of it. OK, cool. So it's the same, the same mechanism. Yeah, yeah, very cool.
And then so having that is a gap that I had. So thank you for that. And then the other gap is so if we have that context and so we know for the back end we're gonna use this these tools for unique testing of the back end, we're gonna use these tools.
For APIs, blah blah blah, all of that is established. Then these 27 user stories may lead. We haven't talked about that yet, but let's see it. Let's say we translate this into tasks and we have, you know, whatever, 108 tasks.
And now we want to go say, just go execute on these or maybe go organize these in something that represents dependencies and then go execute. Yeah, right. I don't know how to do that. Yeah. So either what I in my proof of concept explorations, which, yeah, this is gonna stress this, but like.
I had established an MCP server. Like I said, those 27 user stories became 27 issues in GitHub. Yeah. And then with the establishment of the connection between my repository and GitHub, I could say do issue 5 and be like, let me go pull that up. Oh, I understand you want me to make this whole thing, right? All right, I'm gonna get started on that.
Right. And you can, you can define. I want you to to stop and prompt me so that I can review these things along the way, but like like it will continue on that merry workflow until it finds itself with issue #5, right? But am I waiting for it to be done with issue #5 before I can tell it to go work on issue #11? Certainly not. I mean like.
I would hope that he's working on four while he's working on three. Yeah, but me at my at my computer. Yeah. Can I just say, hey, 15 agents, go do work, come back to me when you're done. I I mean, like, since it's all writing files and creating branches on your local machine anyway, I'm not sure if that.
I don't know how to. Yes. Yeah. Uh, OK. We can, we can, we can figure that that piece of it out. Yeah. OK, cool.
All right. So should we start with our requirements discussion? Yeah. Yeah. Or requirement. Yeah. OK, Yeah. OK. So let's establish for copilot what we're doing or not copilot.
What is this? Mike? Yeah, Copilot. Yeah, this is Office Copilot. Yeah, for Office Copilot, we are now going to enter in a long winded discussion about the requirements for Kaha, an app that's going to raise engagement in our events at this company.
If it's not long winded, tell us cuz we mean for it to be long. So I see it as a platform that is by definition extensible easily that it requires no app to be installed.
Called on anyone's phones that it could just be a modern web application. So I'm gonna be the dumb ape in the room and actually make notes here, but we're not gonna depend on these notes. I'm just gonna write things down so that we can refer to them, right? So you said extensible.
Yeah.
Yeah, right. No apps installed on web-based like, yeah.
Yep. Uh.
Anonymous users. Anonymous users. Oh yeah, uh, support anonymous and not and authenticated anonymous. So being as a, yeah, yeah.
SSL is one, so anonymous mode. But there's also needs to be a authenticated mode, right? Yeah, for the for the admins, like or not for the admins, but like the people creating the content that people are going to interface with.
Maybe. We'll see. Yeah. OK, so that's a stretch goal. Yeah, stretch goal. OK, so the stretch goal is on on on Tristan. I think we do. So that's stretch. That's that's not good. I'll have to.
Yeah. What's that? Me neither. I didn't hear what you said. No, I said I don't have it figured out yet. So if you have the same thing, yeah.
Days offload persistence. Uh, we want like a a persistence. Say more, say more about that joke. Uh, variable persistence. So it could be something that lasts an hour or it could be something that lasts days. OK, so the sessions should mean that a a quote UN quote.
Kaha say session can be of various length. Yep. OK, some of these are principles, some of these are features, but we'll just put them all together right now. Yeah, so uh, variable.
Like someone's really wanting to get in. Yeah, for like sessions, right?
OK, um.
We need the at least three personas. Is this a good time to mention them? Sure. OK, so the first persona is the the unauthenticated users on their web-based phone apps. The second one is.
The OK, let me so personas.
Personas.
So web user? Yep. Anonymous. Yep. OK, there's the the like.
I wanna say admin, but that may be too much. It's just like the room owner. Yeah, that's correct. There's admin. There's also just a viewer. Yes, the viewer is the third one. Yeah. So do we need to talk about, let's talk about the application, right? So there's a thing that's going to happen, which is.
I think we called it here. We called the thing a session. Yeah. Is that a good name for the thing that's happened? Like, I think in the real chat box, it's the game. Yeah, right. But we're not. We're not playing games here. We're working, right. So it's a session. Is that the thing that's happening? Is that the right term for it?
I think event sounds better to me. Arnie module. No, you don't think so. It's a it's a. I mean, event sounds like a really good synonym for something that's happening. Event's good too. Why? Like event is something that happens all day or something.
This is like it could be like 5 minutes. We definitely need to come up with like a a a model of what relates to what. Uh, yeah, but like, um.
OK, so as an admin I can set up a.
Events. Events. Um, that contains, uh, a specific type of activity.
Maybe activity is the thing that we're thinking. Yeah, maybe it is an activity. Yeah. OK, so as an admin, I can create an instance of an activity and configure it for what content I want my end users to see. Yeah, and I think that's good because what is it that we want to do with the activity?
We want the ability. We are basically an engagement platform for activities. Yes, that's what we are. But in that sense, it wouldn't be like a session with 2010 activities or so. Like the session is the whole thing and you can have multiple activities in that.
That's true, right? That I think is the key. So starting very simple, if I just wanted to do a quick poll, I could create a session that contains one poll activity, configure that poll activity with the content I want to show to the users, and then it's kind of similar to PowerPoint.
A new instance of a presentation. I'm filling out the content of that presentation, then I'm starting the presentation and that's where the like QR code and lets people connect to the session and and provide their votes.
But for me, um, I'm gonna make one here. So MCP server.
Bulls.
Teens and individual acceleration.
Wanted.
Memory and orchestration.
Hey, I forgot.
Oh.
We got.
Uh.
Session so Oh yeah, which contains one to many activities.
That are accessible by one too many users like get more complicated than that. Or is like this users is sort of disjointed from that to a different. Yeah, yeah, I think you're right. I think so.
So your activities are going to be containers for.
Quite. I mean, basically what it's it's questions and answers, right? Yeah. But don't they all boil down to that kind of activity? It's like, hey, prompt and answer to the prompt.
Right. It's the prompt may be specifically a multiple choice question or the prompt could be, you know, tell us what you think. It could be survey like, yeah, but I'm I'm just gonna pull a YouTube video.
So we're all on the same printer. So that we can figure it out. Let's see if this is so. Where will your crew trajectory and legends of you as the secret criminal and perspectives? Let's see.
So you're pulling up gameplay? Yeah, yeah. Just so that we're all on the same page about what Jackbox is. Yeah, yeah.
I got.
Oh no, you've tried other party games, but they're just so hard to control. Now the makers of the hit trivia party game You Don't Know Jack introduce the Jackbox Party Pack. The Jackbox Party Pack has not one, not two, not three, not four, not.
Six, but five unique and hilarious party games for one crazy low price. We're going to come back to the main room. We're going to do it. OK, sounds good. See you guys later.
The BS slinging Vivage XL. But that's not all. And so this is this is a view of the viewer persona. Yeah, like like this game has already been constructed. That's this guy, right?
No, no. The Web User Anonymous is gonna be the one that's gonna like like. So in this game, someone drew that and everyone gets to like, say what they think that is a picture of. OK, one of them is really the answer, right? And then they vote on which one they think is the answer, right?
So.
So the phone, the user only sees for them at the right time. They are prompted with an empty text box going. What the hell is this thing? OK, so who's this guy? The web user anonymous. So the phone is where I say I think this is a tiki curse. I hit tiki curse and I hit submit. OK, and then that becomes one of the. So really we should not label this person the web user anonymous.
Web users and they're all anonymous. Yeah, they're they're like participants. This is a participant. Yeah. OK. So this is a participant. Yes. So it's a participant into the activity. Yes. So this is an activity.
I think it's yours. Oh, it doesn't like that.
Oh, so it's an activity participant? Yep. OK, Yep. And then this. So this is the viewer. This is what everyone would see on the TV while they're playing on their phones. OK, And that needs to be a persona of sorts as well, right? Yeah. So this is the activity.
You are, Yeah. OK. Even though no one is really like humanly manifesting that role, it is the thing that is showing on the screen that a human took on that persona. Yeah, to bring that up on their computer. And then they're going to take on the persona of the participant to be one of the.
Players in the game. Now here's the rub. Like there's those are the two personas in Jackbox. Yeah, because Jackbox is a game, right? It like it has a whole bunch of content that is. So we have an additional one. We have an additional one, which is the admin that is setting up the.
Content, right. So it's the activity admin. Yeah. And I would suggest similar to the difference between a PowerPoint person, a person that's setting up the content in the presentation. The viewer is not only just showing a slide, they are also clicking next slide, right?
We've got to have someone that takes us from activity one to activity two to activity three at the right time, right? And all that is is just moving us forward. And if there is only one activity, then there is only one activity, right? But if there's two, if we go from pointing poker to a live poll to something else, then yeah, do you think it makes sense to say that the activity?
Activity viewer is also the activity runner. Or is the activity runner a different persona? No, no, no. I think viewer slash right. It could be the same human, but they could be a different persona. That's legit. Fair, right? That's why we don't say users, we say personas. Yeah, right. Yeah. But I think the running will.
Do you say you're a PowerPoint viewer and a PowerPoint runner, or you're just a PowerPoint presenter? Let's just say viewer runner. Yeah, OK. And then let's see if that distinction takes on more meaning, OK?
To justify separating it, OK. Is there more that you wanted us to see in that? The point to be made is that the interface on the phone is just really simple but dynamic and very two way communication, right? So like and the game is the one that drives the content.
We we basically each one of our games is its own micro front end for the viewer, runner and the participant. That would be an easy and interesting way to. I was gonna say easy, but easy and interesting way of implementing it for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. In time someone says micro.
I know, I know. But they they are that different. It's a completely different experience from game to game. Yeah. Mocking microphones. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I've never say that would be page one and page 2, but sure, microphone. Yeah. I mean, no, that's not. Yeah. OK, so, so.
We have a session, yeah, which we're defining as the main attribute of the session that we're interested in here is that it has a start time and an end time, right? That's what we're trying to get through in session. Yeah, well, yes.
And it's a grouping of activities, right? I'm not sure. But it's a session of class or the object. Exactly, right? That's what I'm trying to get to too. We have types of activities and then we have the configured activities with the content, like pointing poker is worthless, like pointing poker about a story we're pointing.
That's the like instance, right? That's the object. And to take another thing, another example that we talked about is a town hall. In a town hall you may want to have a you wouldn't have point poker, but you might have a live poll and you might have another type of activity that we haven't talked about, right? Or you may have five different live polls where.
In a single a single town hall, right? So the session. So something exists that needs to be a group of activities coming together. That's the object. Yeah, something needs to exist that also defines what the attributes are of a grouping of activities.
And that's the class. And so I don't know if we if we just say there is a session which is the class, and then there's an instance of the session which is the object, I don't know. Or maybe we give them different names because the session, the class doesn't really have a start time and an end time because it's just a grouping of activities that can come together anytime. That's right. And then as soon as you say, oh.
I'm now having a live one of these. Then you give it a start time and an end time. Potentially this is and and and to like this is the a one minute version of like one of the mini games.
OK, Gregory Nelson, killing in for Gilbert Bains, was away protesting Gaye Meredith. Today, for the first time on In the Know, we're giving viewers a chance at home to agree or disagree with our panelists using the Insta poll tracker on our website. Panelists, you'll see live.
Let's get started. The dollar has posted incremental gains against both the pound and the euro in recent weeks. Gregory, it's not that simple. First of all, the value of the dollar is not a reliable indicator of our fiscal health, right? There are a number of factors involved. Is this real or no, it's a parody.
For years to come, the long short and he can see his own polling and where they get better. Well, I actually don't think the situation is quite so grim. I I think that the economy actually is on the rebound. Yeah, I agree. I believe in this gloom and doom stuff. I think that the future is very bright.
As long as we don't pull over, I did not mean to say that the economy is in bad shape. But then you just say that do you believe it will continue to get worse? Exactly. You said that, right? The real reason the economy is doing better right now is because the hard working.
Americans right out there. You know all of the the smart, resilient, hard working Americans out there. Who is going to pay for all these government bailouts? Our children. Our poor, poor children. So this is the average American losing freaking economy? Well, Gregory.
When you come home, open your post office box and find a huge stack of bills. It's it's discouraging because because bills are such a discouraging thing to find when you open your post office box.
And that is not something a person wants to find when they open the post office boxes. In some ways, the economy is like an old post office box. OK, so we'll we'll we'll implement that as a feature.
OK, we were gathering requirements. Oh yeah, I think it just turned itself on when I start sharing.
Tests. Yeah, that's way better. Is the transcription going? Yeah, I think so.
Should end with a few prescription going. There you go. Yep, Yep. All right, so.
I was noodling over multitasking. I was noodling over some ideas for activities too and what the mono repo could be set up. This is totally fine to iterate or push back on it. Is mono repo still the best approach for us? Yes. I think so too. I think so too. And I think the the.
Collaboration thing is overplayed because you can have a monorepo and have different folders and work on the different folders and go to town. You can have, you know, you can pull the monorepo multiple times. Yeah, multiple agents, yeah, yeah, so.
And I'm Boo. Boo. Yeah. What? Yeah. Multi. Yay. Monorepo. Yeah. OK, good, good, good. OK, OK, good. Keeps it simple. And then we're still focusing on the product requirements, not the technicals, right? Like, yeah, OK, OK.
So yeah, I'm thinking like it would be cool if either as a user looking at the viewer or as a user looking at their phone and considering participating that we'd have a live countdown of how much time is left.
Oh, the viewer. OK, yeah, I think on the viewer, if not also on the phone, although that might get out of sync. I don't know if that matters. But like, like the goal is if we're doing an activity and I want like a pointing poker, it's like point your thing. You've got 30 seconds to point the story or we're not going to care about your.
But you know, if like 50 people join or whatever, right? Like then, yeah, say, oh cool, well, 20 of them, I think you may be talking about the different states that I that an activity can have. Yeah. So an activity can be draft mode. It can be potentially.
Published. Yep. And once it's published, it can be opened. And then once it's opened, it can be manually closed or it can have a timeout associated with it, right? No one should be doing administration of a session once it's open.
Um, right. And that's another rule. Yeah. And when it's, when it's, you might wanna kick people out or something. Well, you can do that. Let's say if if any, any action that we wanna do for the live running session, we should be able to do from the viewer.
You know, like like progressing us to the next activity, that's the viewer, right? Taking us back from the to the previous activity, that's the viewer. Like if we need to kick somebody out, that's the viewer. But like the administration is for, I want to start with this activity and I want to configure the activity to show this question.
And solicit feedback. Yeah, OK, so that's the goal. Should have cool and the ability. I can hit play and I can go to the next activity and I can configure an optional timeout for that activity. Just saying, Yep, we're.
Looking for you to give your votes. It's gonna go for 60 seconds and then they should be able to see on the viewer. I've got 5-4. Oh shoot, I forgot to answer **** and now I right counted. So an activity can be in draft mode. It can be in published mode.
It can be in play mode and it can be in expired mode, right? Right. The viewer should obviously be dynamically re rendering based on the stats provided from the clients plural, right? Like as a client says yes or no, it should feed into like a pie chart.
Or a like a number of the responses on the viewer. Yeah, that's the viewer versus the runner. Well, the viewer runner. No, no, no, no. So the participant is taking actions, yeah, related to the activity. And as a result of those actions, the viewer is getting updated.
In real time, right? Yeah, yes. OK. When the viewer goes on to the next activity, all of the participants devices should also dynamically render the interface of that next activity, right? Looking for their two eye feedback. But I think what we're saying with the different states, it could potentially.
When the next activity is, well, maybe this is the right time to discuss that when the next activity is activated then.
The viewer, the participant, sees that activity, but they not may not be able to take action yet. So you can't point a story until it's time to play, you know, playing poker. But you may see that this is the active story that we are talking about now, right? Listen to the conversation.
Look at the details on the story, blah blah blah. And then at some point that activity is going to be live. Now we're asking you to take an action, right? Take the action. You have 30 seconds to do that. Sure. Yeah. OK, yeah.
It's so comforting to know that all this stuff is being recorded, right? Yeah, it's just gonna be captured. That really is very freeing. I haven't. I haven't experienced that before. Oh, nice. Yeah, that's a little bit of a aha moment, I think, for me.
A Kaha moment. Well, you say Kaha, but it's Kaha. OK, And then I started capturing some ideas for what kinds of activities we might have, but like.
Because an activity should be able to collect metadata from the admin to configure the activity, it should be able to define the view mode of that activity and it should be able to separately layout the participant view of that activity.
And that participant view must be by definition like reactive or mobile first or whatever you want to call it, like it should be centric to a mobile dimension. And then I was like thinking what kinds of cool things could we?
Add to a session. We could have a poll activity. All of these are like live and plied. Live pandering is showing the votes for things changing over time. Pointing pokers we talked about a bunch. Word cloud taking users text and like building a word cloud.
Dynamically, based on the prevalence of the words as they come in from the inputs from the users. I don't know if you ever played Knowledge Bowl as a kid. Like at high school, we had this. It was like a game show, like Jeopardy, except we had these giant metal bars.
And and the person would read the question and then as the question was being read, like a team could jump in and say I want to answer it. And then if they haven't listened to the entire question, they may answer the wrong question, right? But they the the person asking the question stops.
Right. And just waits for the the team to like give their response. If it's the correct response, they're awarded points, right? So like we could have something similar where a question just appears on screen, maybe one word at a time and then like the moment a team buzzes in like we like the.
The viewer says yes team or like Tristan on his phone, he buzzed in first. So Tristan answered the question, Tristan answered the question correctly. So I say yes, he answered it correctly and Tristan gets points. OK, so this is one of the activity types that you're saying we're correct. Yeah, like as an admin.
Layout 10 questions and one question at a time. They are prompted to. They're displayed on the viewer. Yeah, and then for like for like 10 seconds the question is up there and like then a whole bunch of people hit the button on their phone, the system tracks.
Who was first? Who was second? Who was third? And we just keep going through the list of people based on when they buzzed in until someone got it right. That very much feels game show A, correct? Unless work event engagement E.
Maybe. I mean, like if, say, yes, I agree that it's like less 20 people or 50 people or whatever are participating. But if it is a small meeting, sure, it is an activity. It could just be one question. Yeah, it could just be one question. And it's not enough to say that it's less game show.
Yeah, more them sure, but yeah, all of which could just be prioritized and put into the backlog. And if you have time for a third or a right one, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think the important thing to think about is, and I don't know if we're answering that now, but.
How do we define the generic version of an activity? Yeah, right. How does that manifest on an admin screen versus a viewer screen versus a participant screen?
Right and.
How does it? How do these different activity types potentially manifest, you know, differently? Yeah, and how much customization do you need? Or is it just generally the format is question, answer. Some of the parameters could be question, answer and we don't care about the order of the answers.
It could be question, answer and everybody gets to answer. It could be question, answer and everybody has to answer. It could be question, answer and it expires after a certain time. You know all those. So those are things to think about and maybe.
Maybe we don't have to sort those out now, but some things to think about totally.
Yeah, like all that what you said.
And then I was thinking within the repo we would have a like I know this is getting beyond the product into the technicals, but like some sort of template activity like this is this is the definition of the template, the metadata about said template like what what information we need.
From the admin to host an instance of this activity, right? If you want to find a custom activity, you have to tell us these things about it, right? Yeah, it could just be like a Jason BLOB if we wanted to get really crappy, right? Like just OK, like you're an admin, you decided to add pointing poker.
Give me some Jason, blah blah. I'll tell you if that's a good Jason. Yeah, give it a name. Give it. Yeah. Choose between these different types of activities. Choose if it has a timeout, doesn't have a timeout. If it has, does every participant need to respond? Yes or no? Blah blah blah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah.
So and then then you define HTML, sweet, sweet, swanky, react, HTML, whatever for the for the view layer and for the participant layer.
And then I guess, oh, a summary screen at the end would be kind of neat. I'm not sure how that fits into this with the whole dynamic. Miro for a second. Oh yeah, whoosh. So summary would be, hey, in this session.
These are all the activities that took place and then some information about each activity, participants, participation rate, blah blah blah. And then from there you can come up with a lot of potential stretch goals like sentiment analysis on.
You know, based on how quickly people answered or didn't answer or you know, participation rates and all that kind of stuff would be interesting too, right?
I I like the aspect of this that's, you know, potentially related to. I I wonder if it would be useful for us to have a North Star of, hey, wouldn't it be great if this at the end of, you know, on Thursday if we ended up with a version of this that actually could be useful for, let's say, town halls?
Yeah, right. To get the feedback, right. To get what? The feedback for this workshop? Yeah, but also to to say, hey, out of this workshop, we came up with something that's actually useful for, let's say, a town hall, for example. And I think some of the sentiment analysis would be would be interesting.
Yeah, you know, try to gauge how engaged your audience really was throughout a, you know, 90 minute time hall. Yeah. Number of participants, number of answers. Get some real KPIs for it or something, yeah.
Yeah, cool.
Right. I wonder as well as it's sorry, just kind of brainstorming, but you know how?
Tony is kind of the numbers guy in the town hall. And so they each have kind of in our exact team, they each have kind of their niche that they they go into in the town halls in general. I wonder that just made me think about.
And you know when you watch a recording of one of these sessions in the live recording reviewer, whatever teams has the teams viewer, you can actually react to moments. So I don't know if you've ever watched a recording after people have reacted to it, but as you watch it, you can see, hey, you know, like people thumbed up.
Up at this point in the conversation and people hearted at this point in the conversation and I'm just wondering if it would be it would be cool to have almost an activity that's so a session has an underlying activity that's just the ability to gather feedback about the session.
Across the entirety of the session. And then you have activities that are specific activities. You see what I'm saying? And it's almost like the same way that when you have a teams meeting, you can actually react to that. You know, in that teams meeting you can just send the hearts or the applause or whatever. You could do that using Kaha.
In real time. And then that could give you a sentiment analysis as well. And you could go almost like the the live view that you showed earlier where the people were actually reacting to that. But yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my dream. I want, I want that for sure.
Interesting. Being able to react to the live sentiment. Yeah, OK.
Especially if it's Tony, you know, or like some sort of executive meeting where, Oh no, we're announcing all these changes. Someone is all excited about the numbers that they're about to get into. Yeah, yeah. Or like they talk about being acquired again and everybody's like, woo.
We don't want to eat. We don't exactly.
OK, we could talk about things we maybe want, but I'm not sure like content moderation. Should we, if we take user content, should it just appear on the screen in front of everybody or should it go through some sort of like?
Either. I don't know about, I don't think human review, but like like some sort of like GPT analysis to just be like, Are we sure this is kosher to show on a screen in front of a bunch of people? Right. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's a good. That's a good.
Feature. Yeah, yeah. Uh, especially if we had an activity where people could take pictures. Oh, wow. That's, yeah. And it's like kind of like, um, uh, like a stadium. But so far the activities I think that we've talked about are more.
Totally. Yeah. Yeah. Q&A with multiple tours. Absolutely. In general, yes. But what if you could have an activity that's just like, for the next 30 minutes, we're just gonna host a live photo board of pictures that people have taken and uploaded to this. Almost like it would be an interesting icebreaker, wouldn't it? To say, hey, you have in this room.
For example, go find someone you've never met in person and take a selfie of the two of you together and post it. Yeah, and if someone takes a picture of their rear end or something, they can send that to Chad GBT and be like, I object to the content. I object to rear ends.
If our objection quotient reach goes above .5.
So that's a stretch goal, stretch goal feature. If we can come up with another live activity of like user submitted photos, that would be cool. And what were the other ones? Emoji reaction?
I'm saying this for the for the transcription. Like if you get like similar to the knowledgeable one where it's like a game show, like just have a list of questions and statements and give participants like a few seconds to like give them a little command console on their phone that just gives an emoji and the title of the question.
They can hit the responses and then we would gather that data and the viewer would just cycle through the questions one after another, just saying to this question, 90% of the people gave a heart emoji, 2% of the people gave a hot dog emoji or something. Yeah, it's almost this, but that's the basic principle of the whole thing. That's just a.
Specialized version of it. Yeah, right. Yeah. A multiple choice question where all the all the choices are reactions. Yeah. OK. It could be yes. Yes. OK.
Yeah.
Yeah, OK, not thinking, just thinking out loud, not thinking out loud. Anything else? I think this is sufficiently ambitious for the next couple of days. I think it's enough to try to stop the transcript and try to extract that into.
So as for the summary of this, then that's the feature discussion MD file. Yep, mark down file. Then combine these two files and say combining these two files now come up with a set of initial set of features. Yep.
In 5 minutes, we just review that together. Yeah. OK, cool.
