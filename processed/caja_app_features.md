# Caja App - High-Level Features

## User Journey Overview

The Caja platform follows a structured flow that supports three main personas through a complete session lifecycle:

### High-Level Session Flow
1. **Admin Setup Phase** (Red boxes in diagram)
   - Admin defines session and configures activities in desired order
   - Session remains in draft state until ready to launch

2. **Session Launch Phase** 
   - Admin opens the session, transitioning it to active state
   - Viewer displays QR code and session join information
   - Participants scan QR code to connect and enter nicknames

3. **Activity Execution Phase** (Purple boxes in diagram)
   - Session progresses through configured activities in sequence
   - Each activity follows the pattern: display → participate → results
   - Activities can include: Pointing Poker, Polls, Word Clouds, etc.
   - Small persistent QR code remains visible for late participants to join
   - Real-time synchronization across all participant devices and viewer

4. **Session Completion Phase** (Blue box in diagram)
   - After final activity, system generates comprehensive summary
   - Summary includes participation metrics, activity results, and analytics
   - Session transitions to completed state

This flow ensures a seamless experience from setup through completion, with clear role separation and consistent state management throughout the session lifecycle.
